Problem: Design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.

Constraints: 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your
choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from online catalog, use max force values only), Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

Chose RSA rod-style actuator: max force 58kN, max stroke length 1.5m

b. Static analysis:

* Bar length L = 1200mm (chosen to fit comfortably inside the 1500 mm span, leaving room for supports/actuator anchors).
* Two ground pins located at the bar ends (left pin A at x=0,y=0, right pin C at x=L,y=0). These are the two pins that must be mounted to the ground.
* Third pin (B) is the actuator-to-bar pin: the actuator attaches to the bar at a point (x=p) (measured from left end along the bar) via a pinned joint. The actuator other end is pinned to the ground at a point offset in the vertical direction (so the actuator has a non-zero angle and produces a vertical component).
* Payload (weight to be lifted) is attached at the right end of the bar (x = L). (This is a simple, clear objective: raise a point load at the end.)
* Geometry chosen to use available height and produce a favorable force angle:

  * bar elevation (attachment height) = h = 400mm above the ground anchor line
  * actuator ground anchor at x=300mm, y=0.
  * actuator attaches to the bar at x=p=900mm, y=40mm.

Assumptions:

* Bar is rigid and pinned at A and C (no bending).
* Actuator provides a line force (F) directed along the actuator rod between its pins. Use the maximum compressive (push) force F=58,000N.
* Only vertical components of forces matter for the load calculation of the payload (we take moments about a support to relate actuator vertical component to the payload).
* All pins are ideal frictionless pins; supports supply vertical reactions.

Geometry and derived quantities:

* Bar length L=1.20m. Attachment position p=0.90m.
* Actuator vector from ground anchor (300 mm, 0) to bar pin (900 mm, 400 mm): horizontal dx = 0.600 m, vertical dy = 0.400 m.
* Actuator angle (theta = arctan(dy/dx)=arctan(0.4/0.6)=33.69).
* Vertical component of actuator force: Fv = Fsin(theta).

Equilibrium (moment balance about left support, A) for the rigid bar:

* For a point payload (W) at (x=L) (downward) and actuator vertical up (Fv) at (x=p), the moment equilibrium about A gives:
  W*L=Fv*p
  W=(Fv*p)/L
  This is the payload that the actuator geometry can statically hold (rigid bar).

Step 2:

a. Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and describe your analysis

Assumptions:

* Loads are transverse (vertical); axial effects are negligible for transverse deflection (actuator axial reaction ignored for deflection).
* Supports are pinned (y=0 at x=0 and x=L).
* Cross-section initially = solid circular diameter (d=40mm) (as in your earlier problem).

Key formulas and procedure:

1. Compute reactions RA, RC from global equilibrium:
   RC=(WL-Fvp0)/L, RA=W-fv-RC
2. Bending moment along the beam (piecewise):
   M(x)=RAx 0<=x<=p, RAx+Fv(x-p) p<=x<=L
3. Solve (E I y''(x) = M(x)) with boundary conditions (y(0)=y(L)=0) and continuity of slope and deflection at (x=p).
4. Evaluate the deflection curve and find the max magnitude.

I=pid^4/64=1.2566x10^=7m^4
* Using (F=58kN) the computed deflection curve gives a maximum deflection
  0.03220m


b. Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.


* Required deflection limit (2% of beam length): 0.02x1.20=0.024m
* Material: steel (E=200GPa)
Ireq=Icurrent * (ycurrent/ytarget)
Icurrent = 1.2566x10^=7m^4, ycurrent = 0.03220m.
Ireq = 1.6861x10^-7m^4

Shape: hollow circular tube

I=pi/64 * (D^4-d^4), A = pi/4(D^2-d^2)
Outer diameter up to D=100mm, solve for inner diameter that gives Ireq:
d=99.13mm (wall thickness = 0.435mm)
cross-sectional area = 1.36x10^-4m^2

c. Present your final beam design in an image or drawing.
